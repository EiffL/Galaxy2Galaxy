# Galaxy2Galaxy

Galaxy2Galaxy, or G2G for short, is a library of models, datasets, and utilities to build generative models for astronomical images, based on the Tensor2Tensor library. Similarly to T2T, the goal of this project is to accelerate research in machine
learning models applied to astronomical image processing problems.
